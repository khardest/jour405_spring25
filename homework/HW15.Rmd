# Analyzing Daily Accident Data with Z-Scores

## Introduction

In this analysis, we'll examine daily accident data from Prince George's County to identify statistically unusual patterns that might lead to newsworthy stories. Z-scores provide a powerful statistical method to determine which days experienced an abnormal number of accidents compared to typical patterns.

A z-score tells us how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean. Generally:
- Z-scores between -2 and 2 represent typical values (about 95% of the data)
- Z-scores beyond ±2 indicate unusual values that might warrant investigation
- Z-scores beyond ±3 are very unusual (only about 0.3% of normally distributed data)

## Setup

Let's start by loading the necessary packages:

```{r load-packages}
library(tidyverse)  # For data manipulation and visualization
library(knitr)      # For nice tables
library(lubridate)  # For working with dates
```

## Loading the Data

We'll load the accident data from our CSV file:

```{r load-data}
# Load accident data
accidents <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/daily_accidents.csv")

# Display the first few rows
head(accidents)

# Check basic info about the dataset
glimpse(accidents)
```

## Data Exploration

Let's first understand our dataset structure:

```{r data-exploration}
# Get a summary of the data
summary(accidents)

# Check how many days we have in total
nrow(accidents)

# Check the date range
min(accidents$date)
max(accidents$date)
```

Now let's create a time series visualization of accidents:

```{r time-series-plot}
# Plot time series
ggplot(accidents, aes(x = date, y = total)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", span = 0.1) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Daily Accidents in Prince George's County",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Number of Accidents",
       caption = "Source: Prince George's County Accident Data")
```

### Task 1 (3 points)
Looking at the time series visualization above, identify at least two noticeable patterns or anomalies. What questions would you want to investigate further based on this initial view of the data? How might these visual patterns translate into potential story angles?

One noticeable pattern is the dip in the number of daily accidents in early to mid 2020, which can most likely be associated with the COVID pandemic. Some questions I would ask could be "How much did overall traffic and cars on the road decrease during the pandemic?", and "Did some accidents decrease more than others?" A story angle could look into how the pandemic increased traffic safety and if any of these stats carried into the future. 

Another one I noticed is that daily accidents have recently been decreasing and on a downward turn. A question I could ask could be "Have any new laws or safety measures relating to traffice been implemented?" A story angle could look at times including this time period where accidents have been on a decline and see if this relates to any safety measures, traffic enforcement, etc.



The daily data is quite noisy, so let's also look at weekly patterns:

```{r weekly-patterns}
# Add day of week 
accidents <- accidents |>
  mutate(
    day_of_week = wday(date, label = TRUE),
    month = floor_date(date, "month"),
    year = year(date)
  )

# Check accident patterns by day of week
day_of_week_summary <- accidents |>
  group_by(day_of_week) |>
  summarize(
    avg_accidents = mean(total),
    median_accidents = median(total),
    max_accidents = max(total),
    min_accidents = min(total)
  )

# Display day of week summary
day_of_week_summary 

# Visualize by day of week
ggplot(accidents, aes(x = day_of_week, y = total)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Accident Distribution by Day of Week",
       x = "Day of Week",
       y = "Number of Accidents",
       caption = "Source: Prince George's County Accident Data")
```

### Task 2 (2 points)
Based on the day-of-week analysis, which day(s) have the highest and lowest average accidents? Why might these patterns exist?

Friday and Saturday have the highest average accidents, probably because it's the weekend and there are more people out drinking and going out because they don't have work.The lowest days are Monday and Wednesday, most likely because they are work/school days so people are probably acting more responsibly. 

## Calculating Z-Scores

Now, let's calculate z-scores for our accident totals:

```{r calculate-z-scores}
# Calculate z-scores for total accidents
accidents <- accidents |>
  mutate(
    mean_accidents = mean(total),
    sd_accidents = sd(total),
    z_score = (total - mean_accidents) / sd_accidents
  )

# Display the data with z-scores
accidents |>
  select(date, day_of_week, total, z_score) |>
  head(10) 
```

## Identifying Unusual Days

Let's identify days with unusually high or low accident numbers (|z-score| > 2):

```{r unusual-days}
# Find days with unusual accident numbers
unusual_days <- accidents |>
  filter(abs(z_score) > 2) |>
  arrange(desc(abs(z_score)))

# Display number of unusual days
cat("Number of days with unusual accident counts:", nrow(unusual_days), 
    "out of", nrow(accidents), "total days (", 
    round(nrow(unusual_days)/nrow(accidents)*100, 2), "%)")

# Display the top 10 most unusual days
unusual_days |>
  head(10) |>
  select(date, day_of_week, total, z_score) 
```

### Task 3 (3 points)
Choose one of the top 10 unusual days and research what might have happened on that date. Look for weather events, holidays, major incidents, or other factors that could explain the unusual number of accidents. Briefly describe your findings and how you would incorporate this context into a story.

I chose 10/29/2021 which had the highest z-score. On this day there was a storm that brought lots of flooding. Larry Hogan declared a state of emergency and the floods caused lots of disturbances on roadways, leading to accidents. For a story I would go into detail of the floods and how they impacted certain roads/the ability to drive and also what measures the government took to keep people safe. 

Let's visualize these unusual days:

```{r plot-unusual-days}
# Highlight unusual days in the time series
ggplot(accidents, aes(x = date, y = total, color = abs(z_score) > 2)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("gray", "red"), 
                     name = "Unusual Value",
                     labels = c("Normal", "Unusual")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Daily Accidents with Unusual Days Highlighted",
       subtitle = "Unusual days have z-scores with absolute values > 2",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Number of Accidents",
       caption = "Source: Prince George's County Accident Data")
```

## Day of Week Patterns

Let's calculate z-scores that account for day of week patterns:

```{r day-of-week-z-scores}
# Calculate day-of-week adjusted z-scores
accidents <- accidents |>
  group_by(day_of_week) |>
  mutate(
    dow_mean = mean(total),
    dow_sd = sd(total),
    dow_z_score = (total - dow_mean) / dow_sd
  ) |>
  ungroup()

# Find days with unusual day-of-week z-scores
unusual_dow <- accidents |>
  filter(abs(dow_z_score) > 2) |>
  arrange(desc(abs(dow_z_score)))

# Display the top unusual days adjusted for day of week
unusual_dow |>
  head(10) |>
  select(date, day_of_week, total, dow_mean, dow_z_score) 
```

### Task 4 (3 points)
Compare the days that have extreme z-scores overall versus those with extreme day-of-week z-scores. How do these lists differ? What journalistic insights can you draw from comparing these two different approaches to measuring "unusual" days?

These lists differ because while the extreme z-scores list shows days that have an unusual accident count is compared to all other days, the extreme day of week z-scores list shows days that have an unusual accident count compared to other days that fell on the same weekday. While the overall list is dominated by Fridays and Saturdays because most accidents fall on those days, the day of week list is more scattered and has days that don't fall in the category of the highest number of accidents. For example, May 5 was unusual for a Wednesday, but not necessarily for all days. Some journalistic insights I can draw include:

-Weekends dominate overalloutliers in accidents.
- Just because a day is unusual overall does not mean it is unusual in terms of the day of the week it falls on





Let's see how many unusual days we have for each day of the week:

```{r unusual-by-dow}
# Count unusual days by day of week
unusual_count_by_dow <- accidents |>
  filter(abs(dow_z_score) > 2) |>
  count(day_of_week) |>
  arrange(desc(n))

# Get total count by day of week for comparison
total_by_dow <- accidents |>
  count(day_of_week)

# Join to calculate percentages
unusual_rates <- unusual_count_by_dow |>
  left_join(total_by_dow, by = "day_of_week") |>
  rename(unusual_days = n.x, total_days = n.y) |>
  mutate(
    pct_unusual = (unusual_days / total_days) * 100
  )

# Display results
unusual_rates 
```

## Monthly Patterns

Let's examine if certain months have more unusual days:

```{r monthly-patterns}
# Extract month from date for seasonal analysis
accidents <- accidents |>
  mutate(month_of_year = month(date, label = TRUE))

# Calculate average accidents by month
monthly_pattern <- accidents |>
  group_by(month_of_year) |>
  summarize(
    avg_accidents = mean(total),
    median_accidents = median(total)
  )

# Plot monthly pattern
ggplot(monthly_pattern, aes(x = month_of_year, y = avg_accidents, group = 1)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Average Daily Accidents by Month",
       x = "Month",
       y = "Average Number of Accidents",
       caption = "Source: Prince George's County Accident Data")

# Calculate month-adjusted z-scores
accidents <- accidents |>
  group_by(month_of_year) |>
  mutate(
    monthly_mean = mean(total),
    monthly_sd = sd(total),
    monthly_z_score = (total - monthly_mean) / monthly_sd
  ) |>
  ungroup()

# Find days with unusual monthly z-scores
unusual_monthly <- accidents |>
  filter(abs(monthly_z_score) > 2) |>
  arrange(desc(abs(monthly_z_score)))

# Display top days that are unusual for their month
unusual_monthly |>
  head(10) |>
  select(date, month_of_year, day_of_week, total, monthly_mean, monthly_z_score) |>

```

### Task 5 (2 points)
Based on the monthly pattern analysis, which months have the highest and lowest average accidents? Develop a hypothesis about why these seasonal patterns exist.

The highest average accident month is October while the lowest is January. October could be the highest due to fall weather such as leaves rain and fog making roads slick, or school year/work commuting traffic being fully back by this time. January could be low due to people driving more carefully or not driving at all due to snow.

## Identifying Extreme Outliers

Let's look specifically at days with extremely unusual accident counts (z-scores beyond ±3):

```{r extreme-outliers}
# Find extreme outliers
extreme_outliers <- accidents |>
  filter(abs(z_score) > 3) |>
  arrange(desc(abs(z_score)))

# Display extreme outliers
if(nrow(extreme_outliers) > 0) {
  extreme_outliers |>
    select(date, day_of_week, total, z_score)

} else {
  cat("No days with z-scores beyond ±3 were found in the dataset.")
}
```

### Task 6 (2 points)
For the extreme outliers identified (z-scores beyond ±3), what do they have in common?

Most fall on Fridays and Saturdays where there is a lot of travel, social outings and things going on at night. Many of them are in early spring where weather is variable, rainy and hard to predict.  

## Your Best Story Pitch

### Task 7 (5 points)
Based on all the analyses performed, craft your best story pitch, including a headline and lede. Be sure to include what kinds of sources/people you'd talk to for the story.

Weekend Wrecks: Why Prince George's County Sees a Spike in Accidents over the Weekend.

Days with an unusually high number of car accidents in the county often occur on Fridays and Saturdays, data analysis shows.

I would want to talk to police to see the causes of these accidents and if they fall within a specific age group (young people) or if there is an overwhelming cause such as drunk driving. I would also want to talk to people in the county frequently driving on the roads to see if they notice people driving more irresponsibly on these days.
